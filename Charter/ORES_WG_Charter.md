# Charter for Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Working Group at LF Energy

## Mission Statement

To revolutionize the residential renewable energy sector by developing an open standard architecture, API, and protocol, fostering innovation, accessibility, and sustainability.

## Background
The formation of the Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) Working Group is a follow-up endeavor that stems from the insights of the LF Research whitepaper  ["The Open Source Opportunity for Microgrids: Five Ways to Drive Innovation and Overcome Market Barriers for Energy Resilience."](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/open-source-opportunity-for-microgrids)  In light of the considerable potential for open source solutions in areas such as Microgrids, Virtual Power Plants, and Distributed Energy Resources, Futurewei has taken the initiative to develop a thoughtful and innovative architecture for ORES. This includes designing a power network topology, block diagrams, functional requirements, and core design principles. Supported by community interest, this effort led to the creation of the ORES Working Group within LF Energy.

## Objective
ORES aims to develop an open standard architecture, API, and protocol for renewable energy systems, initially for residential use cases. This project seeks to provide an open alternative to  the dominance of proprietary black box energy solutions and promote a more open, innovative, and collaborative approach in the renewable energy sector.

## Initial Contribution
Futurewei will contribute the initial project design specifications, architecture, API specifications, and protocols to the LF Energy community. Furthermore, Futurewei will sponsor a hardware vendor to further develop the specification, and to further design and implement these standards, providing a reference implementation of the ORES standard.

## Problem Statement

The residential renewable energy sector is currently hindered by several key issues:

1. **Prohibitive Costs**: The high cost of equipment, installation, and permitting presents a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of renewable energy systems.
2. **Proprietary and Black Box Solutions**: The market is largely dominated by proprietary and black box solutions, notably from major industry players, leading to a lack of transparency, limited consumer choice, and hindered innovation.
3. **Lack of Open Solutions**: Based on the [research report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/open-source-opportunity-for-microgrids), there is a critical need for open solutions in this field to encourage innovation, increase consumer choices, and break the monopoly of proprietary systems.
4. **Regulatory and Integration Hurdles**: Complex regulations and opaque interfaces with utility grids are major obstacles to the adoption of open renewable systems and DIY solutions.

## Description

ORES aims to address these challenges by developing a set of easy-to-follow open standard specifications on system architecture, APIs, and communication protocols that empower device manufacturers, hardware and software developers, and DIYers to implement their own disaggregated, easy-to-use and plug-and-play renewable energy solutions, initially for residential use cases, and potentially expand to commercial and industrial usage scenarios in the future.


## Key Deliverables

1. **ORES Specification**: Develop ORES standards including architecture, APIs, and communication protocols among various system modules and components, and cloud APIs.
2. **Reference Implementation**: Develop a working demo system  of the ORES specification.
3. **Multi-vendor adoption and interoperability**: Standards exhibits value when multiple vendors adopt it. Target at least one other hardware vendor's adoption of ORES.
3. **Utility's participation, engagement, adoption**: Adoption and recognition of ORES standards by Utilities encourage mass adoption of ORES by consumers and manufacturers. Target at least one Utility service provider's adoption of ORES.
3. **Marketing and Community Engagement**: Execute strategies for broader adoption and stakeholder engagement.

## Working Group Detailed Operation Plan

1. **Guidance and Strategy**: Provide expertise on technical, business, and policy aspects, steering the project's direction.
